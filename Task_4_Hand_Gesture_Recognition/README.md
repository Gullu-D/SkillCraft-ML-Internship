# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning

This project is part of the **SkillCraft Technology ML Internship**.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a hand gesture recognition model to classify images into categories like:
- Fist
- Hello
- Peace
- Thumbs Up

## 📁 Dataset
Synthetic placeholder dataset with 4 gesture categories:
- Located under the `dataset/` folder
- 5 images per gesture
- Image size: 64x64 px

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- PIL (Pillow)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 Methodology
1. Load image data and flatten it for model input
2. Assign numeric labels to gestures
3. Split into train-test sets
4. Train an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** classifier
5. Evaluate with:
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix

## 📊 Output
Confusion matrix:
- Model correctly classified all test samples

Visuals stored in the `output/` folder:
- `classification_report.txt`
- `confusion_matrix.png`

## ✅ Result
- Achieved **100% accuracy** on test data with limited placeholder images
- Ready for expansion with real-world gesture datasets
